        The classic fable The Tortoise and the Hare tells the story of a race between two very different animals. 
        The hare is fast, confident, and boastful, while the tortoise is slow but determined. 
        One day, the hare mocks the tortoise for being so slow, and the tortoise challenges him to a race. 
        Amused by the idea, the hare accepts, believing he will easily win.
      </p>
      <p>
      When the race begins, the hare speeds far ahead, leaving the tortoise behind. Confident in his victory, 
      he decides to take a nap, thinking he has plenty of time before the tortoise catches up. 
      Meanwhile, the tortoise moves steadily forward, never stopping or giving up. While the hare sleeps, 
      the tortoise continues inching closer to the finish line.
      </p>
      <p>
      By the time the hare wakes up, he realizes the tortoise is almost at the finish line. 
      He dashes forward as fast as he can, but it's too lateâ€”the tortoise crosses the finish 
      line first and wins the race. The story teaches an important lesson: slow and steady wins the race, 
      emphasizing the value of perseverance, patience, and humility over arrogance and overconfidence.
